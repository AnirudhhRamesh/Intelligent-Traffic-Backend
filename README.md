# Making Intelligent Traffic

## Overview
Making Intelligent Traffic is a project that we developed at EPFL for the course "Making Intelligent Things" (CS-358) taught by Professor Christoph Koch. 

Since this was the first year this course has been running, it was open exclusively to 2nd and 3rd year students in the IC bachelor's section. Thus, our team consists of 5 EPFL BSc Computer Science students: Alexander Muller, Anirudhh Ramesh, Damian Kopp, Louis Domart, Luca Engel.

In order to read about what our project proposed, we suggest you read our project proposal here: **INSERT PROJECT PROPOSAL LINK**. 

Please note, that due to time contraints, unforeseen challenges and the EPFL workload, there have been deviations from what we set out in this proposal. The main difference being that, in the end we have implemented a traffic simulation using multiple bluetooth-controlled hardware cars which, when clicking on a cell on our GUI, will create a "passenger" and designate a car (using the algorithm we have described further below) to include it to their planned trajectory in order to "pick-up" this passenger.

## Quick start guide for Traffic simulation project
This is a quick rundown on how to get a version of our project launched and running yourself. It includes useful learning resources and examples as well as instructions to launch the codebase.
