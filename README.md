# Making Intelligent Traffic

## Overview
Making Intelligent Traffic is a project that we developed at EPFL for the course "Making Intelligent Things" (CS-358) taught by Professor Christoph Koch. 

Since this was the first year this course has been running, it was open exclusively to 2nd and 3rd year students in the IC bachelor's section. Thus, our team consists of 5 EPFL BSc Computer Science students: Alexander MÃ¼ller, Anirudhh Ramesh, Damian Kopp, Louis Domart, Luca Engel.

In order to read about what our project proposed, we suggest you read our project proposal here: **INSERT PROJECT PROPOSAL LINK**. 

Please note that due to time contraints and unforeseen challenges, there have been deviations from what we set out in this proposal. The main difference being that, in the end we have implemented a traffic simulation using multiple bluetooth-controlled hardware cars which, when clicking on a cell on our GUI, will create a "passenger" and designate a car (using the algorithm we have described further below) to include it to their planned trajectory in order to "pick-up" this passenger.

## 3D Design
The first step in the project was designing the cars. To make a suitable car for our project, it took us two attempts;

On the first attempt we had a car with all the necessary components, but ended up with a turning radius to large for us to run in our camera's view. 

Hence, we had to redesign the cars from scratch with a focus on minimizing the wheelbase length (the distance between front wheel axle and back wheel axle) which in turn (no pun intended) will reduce the turning radius (so cars will have much tighter turns). 
We also took this opportunity to also use a differential in the second design, since it would prevent wheel slip (and make for more stable driving & turns). If you would like to know more about what a differential is and how it works, check out [this great explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYAw79386WI).

### Sketches
Designing a great, robust car is no easy task; you must place your components in an optimal way and ensure your parts are designed such that they can be 3D printed with minimal supports.

The best advice to begin with is to start with simple sketches. This will enable you to work much faster and visualise a design quickly and see what further ways you can improve the design. Don't hesitate to spend multiple days on this, and also speak to others to get new ideas.

For a better feel, you can also try working with lego and your arduino components to see how things could fit together.

Below are a few ideas/sketches that we had while designing our car and trying to minimize the wheel base:

**INSERT NOTES SKETCHES**

Given that we were trying to minimize the wheelbase in order to reduce the turning radius, we made several design choices:
- We turned the servo backwards so that it would rest in the front of the car. This meant it would reduce the wheelbase by approximately 40%
- We made sure there was enough clearance for the wheels, such that they could freely turn without hitting the 3D base plate. This allowed the wheels to turn much further and reduced the turn radius significantly.
- We kept the 6x AA battery pack vertically stacked, reducing the wheel base even further
- We moved the motor to behind the rear wheel axle, to reduce the wheelbase distance


Due to the time restrictions (we had to redesign and reprint our entire car 4 weeks from the deadline), the priority was really to get a robust car that could drive reliably and perform precise turns. So this was the motivation for the above design choices.

However, with more time we certainly could have spent much more time iterating and making our car much more sleek, which we suggest you to do:
- Try a 4x AA battery pack
- Use an ATTINY microcontroller
- Use the smaller motor controller and try to vary the voltage to change the car speed
- ...

### Bricklayer studio
Once you have a clear final sketch of how you want to design your car, you can start with the implementations.

For us, since we would be using some lego components in our car (the gears, the differential, the lego axles and holes, the wheels) we first need to create a 3D model that we could then import into our Fusion 360 design. We have chosen to use these Lego components since they are much more durable than 3D printed PLA/PETG and hence will make our car more robust.

In order to create the 3D lego models, we use [Studio 2.0 from bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page). Their software is incredibly easy to use, we didn't have to follow any tutorials. We recommend just trying to drag in some lego parts and move them around and build something to learn quickly.

For us, it consisted of making the front and rear axles, which we then exported into two separate models. The front axle contained the steering assembly (wheels, axles, auxiliary parts and the gears for the servo). The rear axle modelled the lego differential and the wheels.

Once you have made your design, you can then export it to use in Fusion 360. Unfortunately, we were unable to directly export it into Fusion 360, we must instead:
- Within Studio 2.0, File>Export As> "Collada" (.dae)
- Use an online converter to convert the .dae into a .stl file type (we used [this](https://imagetostl.com/convert/file/dae/to/stl))
- Then import it into Fusion360. You'll notice it will be incredibly big and in the wrong orientation, to get the correct dimensions you will need to:
  - "Edit in place" your design, then scale down your lego model to a factor of exactly 0.04
  - Rotate the lego car model as needed

### Fusion 360
Unlike Studio, Fusion 360 has a very steep learning curve and getting started will be tough (and even with experience it is a very time-consuming process). This is why we really emphasise the importance of sketching out and planning your designs on paper first, you will save days if not weeks!

The best way to get started with Fusion 360 is to follow online tutorials, since there are many great tutorials. On top of the lectures that our professor made for us, here are some useful channels:
- For beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5bc9c3S12g&ab_channel=LarsChristensen
- Tips to design faster and better: https://www.youtube.com/c/TylerBeckofTECHESPRESSO

There are many more resources so simply search up on Google or YouTube for these.

Regarding our designs, we tried going for a simpler body in order to save time with designing our parts and manufacturing our cars.

After 2-3 iterations we were able to finalise our design to the following:
**INSERT PHOTO OF THE FINAL DESIGN**

Here you can see the comparison with the inital car design we had. You can see that all the hard work we put into sketching out and designing the car beforehand paid off, we had an almost 40% smaller wheelbase and our wheels could turn fully without any obstructions.

The main components of the 3D design is split into a dual-body design, the base plate and the battery holder:
- The base plate connected all the wheel axles, and also held the battery box and the servo. We improved our design to include a motor axle (to hold the motor gear more steadily) and also a screwhole to add a servo axle holder (to hold it firmly against the steering assembly).

- The battery holder is a thick case (we made it slightly too thick) where we could firmly hold the 6x AA battery pack with batteries inside. It also had screwholes across so we could secure the arduino and motor controller on top. This battery holder also had a rear segment to hold the motor in place. We later also designed a holder which we screwed onto the battery holder to hold the bluetooth module and stick the april tag on.

Thanks to this dual-body design, it was fairly simple to mount the components on (it was only a matter of screwing in the components).

With more time, it would certainly be interesting to test out a cantilever "clip-in" design, to avoid using screws, but this requires lots of trial and error, and from experience 3D printed cantilevers are not very malleable and are hard to pull out once clipped in.

You could also try make a sleek car body, to cover the entire car chassis and components making the design look much more appealing.


### 3D Printing with Prusa
Once you have all your components finalised in Fusion 360, you can File>3D Print then export your components as .stl files.

Depending on your printer set-up, you can then print out these components and then assemble your cars.

In our case, we used the Prusa printers (Original Prusa i3 MK3S & MK3S+) at our campus. We printed using 0.2MM and PETG material.

If you similarly have a prusa printer, then you need to install the [Prusa software and drivers](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/), set-up as required then import the .stl files into the prusa software.

You can then move around the components in order to minmize the support structures needed, and make sure you printed axle holes flat (printing them "vertically" will cause them to print as a slight oval due to gravity).

Then, once all your parts are printed (make sure you search online and get a proper formation on how to 3D print!) you can assemble your parts and start wiring and programming!
